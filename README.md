Notes/Comments: 
This was my first time making an iOS application and I had a lot of fun doing so. This application integrates many parts of the iOS environment including: UITableViews, UITableView Delegate and Datasource methods, Cocoapods, UIViewController Autolayout, and Timers. I also learned a lot about UI design and application flow.
