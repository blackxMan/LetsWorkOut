# The 7 Minute Workout / LetsWorkOut

The 7 Minute Workout is an iOS application written in Swift. It includes an outline of each exercise in the workout, a video and text description of each exercise, and a countdown timer for each exercise.

Frameworks/Cocoapods used: ChameleonFramework, MZTimerLabel, Youtube-IOS-Player-Helper



Notes/Comments: 
This was my first time making an iOS application and I had a lot of fun doing so. This application integrates many parts of the iOS environment including: UITableViews, UITableView Delegate and Datasource methods, Cocoapods, UIViewController Autolayout, and Timers. I also learned a lot about UI design and application flow.
